DelayBot
========
DelayBot is a Zulip bot that allows users to create scheduled Zulip messages. It can be called from public channels and private messages, although it gives all replies in private. Some ideas for uses are self-reminders, calling other bots, and scheduled announcements. Messages created using DelayBot will be attributed to their original sender.  

DelayBot was started as a fork of Bot-Builder (https://github.com/di0spyr0s/Bot-Builder).
